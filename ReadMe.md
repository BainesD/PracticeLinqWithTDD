<h2 align="center"> My Goal & Why You Should Use This Repository </h2>
<p align="center">

My goal is to provide a project where you can practice Linq and/or Test Driven Development.

		Both of these are valuable skills that any developer can benefit from learning.

Even if you are already familiar with both of these skills, continuing to hone your craft will help your career.
